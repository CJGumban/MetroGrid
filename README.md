In developing the app, I've decided to use MVVM architecture. I separated the data and UI to make it easier to navigate. The challenging part is looking for a public API that aligns with the app requirements, but I've managed to find a public API that has most of the required data, although it needs a bit of tweaking. I've used this api https://v6.bvg.transport.rest/api.html. The API returns a list of stations, but it returns all of them if the search query is empty, so I added a single letter to make the limit parameter work and avoid the device from lagging. I've applied offline mode by using pagination with a remote mediator. The API doesn't support pagination, so I only load it once and use a remote mediator to store it in the roomdb after it successfully fetches the latest data, overwriting the previous one.  In the details screen, I use a lazy column and custom composables to show the  departure schedules of the  station. I've also added a reusable custom error dialog to handle error messages. I've also applied themes, giving the app a unique feel.
